# Faucet Drop

**Faucet Drop** is an easy-to-use app on a blockchain mainnet (Currently on Arbitrum) designed to share Ether (ETH) with many people in a secure and organized way. It’s perfect for giving out ETH to large groups, helping new users get started with Web3, or rewarding participants at events — similar to digital collectibles (like POAPs). The system includes a **Faucet Factory** to create individual faucets and **Faucet contracts** to manage ETH distribution.

## 🧩 Purpose

Faucet Drop makes it simple to share ETH with others. You can use it to:

* **Share ETH with Many People:** Run promotions, giveaways, or community distributions.
* **Welcome New Web3 Users:** Help them cover gas fees and try blockchain apps easily.
* **Reward Event Participants:** Hand out ETH like a digital badge or collectible.
* **Support Developers:** Provide ETH for testing dApps on mainnet.
* **Control Distribution:** Choose who can claim ETH and when.

Anyone can create a faucet, add ETH to it, and decide who can claim it. It’s a flexible tool for any kind of ETH distribution.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Faucet Drop has three main components:

### 1. Faucet Factory

* **Create a Faucet:** Anyone can create a new faucet (e.g., “Community Giveaway”).
* **Track Faucets:** See a list of all faucets, faucet details, and owners.

### 2. Faucet

Each faucet is a tool that handles:

* **Set Rules:** Define claim amount, start/end times, and add users to a whitelist.
* **Add ETH:** Fund the faucet. A small platform fee is taken automatically.
* **Claim ETH:** Approved users can claim during the active period.
* **Track Claims:** The faucet tracks who has claimed to prevent double-claiming.
* **Manage ETH:** Owners can reclaim leftover ETH or transfer control.

### 3. ETH Handling

* Faucet Drop uses native ETH — no tokens, no extra steps.
* ETH can be sent or claimed directly, with minimal complexity.

## 💸 Platform Covers Gas Fees

Faucet Drop is designed for accessibility:

> 🟢 **Claiming ETH is completely gasless.**
> The platform **covers all gas fees** for users when claiming from a faucet.

This makes it perfect for onboarding new users who might not have ETH yet, or for large-scale promotions where you want zero friction in the claiming process.

---

## 🧪 Example Workflow

1. **Create a Faucet:** e.g., “New User Welcome.”
2. **Set Rules:** 0.01 ETH per person, 1-week duration, whitelist 1,000 users.
3. **Fund the Faucet:** Add 10 ETH. A small fee goes to the platform.
4. **Let Users Claim:** Whitelisted users claim their ETH **gas-free**.
5. **Wrap Up:** Owner checks claims and reclaims leftover ETH.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

* **Mass ETH Sharing:** Easily distribute ETH to thousands for promotions.
* **Onboard New Users:** Provide ETH for first-time transactions and app usage.
* **Event Rewards:** Reward event attendance like a collectible (POAP).
* **Developer Support:** Supply ETH to builders testing live dApps.

---

## ⚠️ Mainnet Considerations

* **Platform Covers Gas:** All user claim actions are **gasless**.
* **ETH Value:** ETH is real money — plan distribution securely.
* **Platform Fee:** A small fee is deducted from added ETH to sustain the system.
* **Owner Actions:** Creating faucets or managing funds may still cost gas (for the faucet owner).

## 🚀 Getting Started

3. **Set Claim Rules & Whitelist Users**
4. **Add ETH to Faucet**

## ✅ Tips for Safe Use
